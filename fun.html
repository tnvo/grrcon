            <h4>Hacker Feud</h4> Are you ready for the 4th Annual Hacker Family Feud!??? <br /> The game is simple. During the After Party on Thursday night teams name the most popular responses to our surveys of random hackers and people. Get something wrong, pay the penalty.
            Not for the easily offended or those without a sense of humor and a strong alcohol tolerance.
            <br />

            <b>NO PICTURES OR VIDEO WILL BE ALLOWED OR TOLERATED</b>

            <br /> 1st place team: $$$ <br /> 2nd place team: $$ <br /> Help be part of the problem and answer the survey questions that will be used during the game! <br />

            <br /> <br /> -------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
            <h4>Open Hacking Village (OHV)</h4> The newly pronounced Open Hacking Village is completely free and available for all to attend (noob to expert). In its first year opening, the OHV will be hosting a list of environments for hackers to tinker around in. The main area’s the
            OHV will be focusing on include, Enterprise, Automotive and IoT (More info on these below). The thought of this village is to give people a free, legal environment to learn the tricks of the trade in hacking, test exploits out in, identify
            new exploits, learn from others, etc. The possibilities are endless and GrrCON is happy to announce the first environment of its kind. Come check us out in the vendor area!

            <h4>Enterprise Hacking Village</h4> Ever want the chance to tinker with enterprise related networks, architectures, platforms, etc? Well the enterprise hacking village is for you! In this village there will be a simulated “enterprise” network setup for conference attendees
            to connect into and play around with. This environment is the old GrrCON CTF setup, so you may see something familiar, but we’ve also added a few more openly vulnerable systems to the network for conference attendees to play around with.
            <br /><br /> -------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
            <h4>Car Hacking Village</h4> Brought to you by CANBUSHACK team, conference attendees will get hands on experience in hacking automotive technologies. Not only will this village be openly available to the public, but there will also be a huge opportunity to learn the
            art of hacking vehicles. There is no formal agenda setup, rather a table with a few automotive components and benches for attendees to interact with.

            <br /><br /> -------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
            <h4>IoT Hacking Village</h4> Toasters, refrigerators, watches, shoes are all being connected to the Internet, but majority of these devices do so very insecurely. Interested in playing around with the devices people are labeling as the Internet of Things? If so, come
            check out this village, connect in your laptop and grab shell on that newly developed “smart” device to make it do things it’s not supposed to.
